# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 1, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Started 100-days-of-code and deliberate practice, Worked on JavaScript in class.

**Thoughts:** Learned that JavaScript is not that different from C++ mainly with some of the syntax and the operators.

### Day 1: May 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through some of the exercises for HTML/CSS

**Thoughts** I have learned about the different ways to change the background color, font color, font family, the borders of an image, how to insert an image, how to resize an image, how to change padding and margins as well, etc. I didn't really have any issues with following along with how the items and syntax was supposed to be typed in and actually putting that knowledge to use.

### Day 2: May 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through all of the exercises for Responsive Design with Bootstrap

**Thoughts** I have learned that there are alot shortcuts that you can use with bootstrap that allows you to have functionality as well as speed. I didn't really have any issues with following along with the lessons. I found it entertaining to see what I was coding right along side the code so I think that having that helped me understand what I was learning.


### Day 3: May 3, 2017
**Today's Progress**: I've gone through more of the Basic JavaScript exercises

**Thoughts** I have learned that JavaScript has alot of similarities with C++ mainly in syntax. There are a few things that are different with the coding itself but it isn't too different to where I wouldn't understand how to code out the scenarios that are given. I found that some of the directions that it gave for you to code was kind of confusing but with some help and reviewing of past lessons I quickly remembered exactly how to solve the issue.


### Day 4: May 4, 2017
**Today's Progress**: I've almost completed the Basic JavaScript exercises

**Thoughts** I have learned that the thing that I do not like about some of these exercises is that in order for you to complete the exercises everything has to be exactly how it is required. I got stuck on the exercise "Manipulating Complex Objects" for almost 20 minutes due to not noticing a missing comma after the first element of the array for myMusic.


### Day 5: May 5, 2017
**Today's Progress**: I've finished the Basic JavaScript exercises and I have also completed the Object Oriented and Functional Programming exercise

**Thoughts** I have learned that there are many functions that work for arrays and strings that I have never heard of or used until I have gone through some of the exercises. I had issues today with remembering some of the syntax which caused some frustration. Although even with the frustration I am still enjoying the exercises and how simple it is to learn the concepts being taught.


### Day 6: May 6, 2017
**Today's Progress**: I've continued with the Basic Algorithm Scripting

**Thoughts** I didn't really get too far on Basic Algorithm Scripting because of getting stuck on trying to remember how to reverse a string. I ended up having to look up for resources on how to do it, I also got stuck on factoralizing a number and had to look for help to solve that as well.


### Day 7: May 7, 2017
**Today's Progress**: I've continued with the Basic Algorithm Scripting

**Thoughts** I still haven't gotten too far on Basic Algorithm Scripting because of getting stuck on Checking for Palindromes and syntax errors with my code for Finding the longest word of a string. There are still many things to learn and try to remember how and when to use them. I also had to have some friends give some help with remembering some of the minor syntax errors that I kept missing.


### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
