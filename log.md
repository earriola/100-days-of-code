### Day 1: May 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through some of the exercises for HTML/CSS

**Thoughts** I have learned about the different ways to change the background color, font color, font family, the borders of an image, how to insert an image, how to resize an image, how to change padding and margins as well, etc. I didn't really have any issues with following along with how the items and syntax was supposed to be typed in and actually putting that knowledge to use.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
